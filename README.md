## What the application does?

Verdure is a mobile application allowing you to scan your food products to find out their nutritional qualities but also - and especially - their environmental impacts.

Because reducing our impact becomes one of the most important issues, Verdure tries to help you by offering you similar products with a lower impact.

## Where does the data come from?

The information comes from the collaborative Open Food Facts database. These can sometimes be insufficient or incorrect depending on the product, if this is the case do not hesitate to [contribute](#contribute).

The Eco-score is an environmental rating calculated by Open Food Facts, you can find out more [here](https://docs.score-environnemental.com).

## Contact and assistance

You can write to [verdure_app@icloud.com](mailto:verdure_app@icloud.com) or create a ticket [here](https://github.com/FredJul/verdure/issues/new) for any bug report or suggestion.

## Privacy policy

Application data is stored locally on your device.

Only the bar codes and your researches are sent to the Open Food Facts servers in order to be able to retrieve information on the different products.

## Contribute

If you want to help this project, I invite you to make a donation to the association [Open Food Facts](https://openfoodfacts.org/donate-to-open-food-facts), on which this project is based on.

You can also use their site and mobile apps to add or improve products. To be able to display the Eco-Score, it is necessary to provide at least the category, the origin of the ingredients and the packaging information (photos and description).

## How to compile?

Verdure is a Flutter project, so you need to [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to be able to compile it.

Verdure always uses the latest stable version of Flutter and I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the official Flutter extension) since this project already contains VSCode config files.
